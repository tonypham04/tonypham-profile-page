# Summary
On my [profile page](https://tonypham-profile-page.herokuapp.com/ "Tony Pham's Profile Page") you will find an informal introduction to who I am and some of the different projects I have worked on.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was primarily to practice using [Angular](https://angular.io/ "Angular Main Page").
I had been encouraged by friends and co-workers to try out this frontend framework (several jobs in web development also seemed to ask for it :sweat_smile:) so I gave it a shot!

## Technologies Used
While going into this project I was primarily looking to try out Angular I also happened to practice using the following other technologies:
- The [disclosure HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details "MDN page on the disclosure element") (&lt;details&gt;)
- CSS keyframe animations
- [Bootstrap Cards Component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/card/ "Bootstrap Card Component") and [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap Icons Main Page")
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript main page")
- Deployment using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku Main Page") cloud application platform

This project uses Angular CLI version 13.1.1.
